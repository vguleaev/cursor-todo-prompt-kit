## TODO.md and CT Rules

When a file called `TODO.md` is present in the project root, you should follow these rules:

- When you are asked to create or update `CT-<number>` task, you should use `TODO.md` file.
- When you are asked about `CT-<number>` task, you should check `TODO.md` file for the task.
- When you think `CT-<number>` task is completed, you should mark it as `✅ DONE` in `TODO.md` file.
